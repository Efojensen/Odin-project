        <Blockquote>Fufu (or fufuo, foofoo, foufou /ˈfuˌfu/ foo-foo listen (help·info)) is a pounded meal found in West African cuisine.
            It is a Twi word that originates from the Akans in Ghana. The word, however, has been expanded to include several variations of the pounded meal found in other African countries.
            Although the original food ingredient for fufu is boiled cassava, plantains and Cocoyam, yams (Ghana), it is also made in different ways in other West African countries; each country has its unique way of making it.
            In Ghana, Ivory Coast and Liberia, they use the method of separately mixing and pounding equal portions of boiled cassava with green plantain or cocoyam, or by mixing cassava/plantains or cocoyam flour with water and stirring it on a stove.
            Its thickness is then adjusted to personal preference, and it is eaten with broth-like soups. In Nigeria, fufu (akpu) is made solely from fermented cassava giving it its unique thickness compared to that found in other west African countries, and eaten with variety of soups with vegetables and lots of beef and fish.
